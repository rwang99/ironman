# ironman
Basic Tony Stark arc reactor light arduino code for Arduino Circuit Playground

End goal would be something along the lines of the arc reactor shining through a tshirt from the Iron Man movie. Would have cool functions such as fluctuating brightness, cool effects, and whatever else I can think of.

Miniproject with arduino, really the first time I ever did anything on my own with it.
